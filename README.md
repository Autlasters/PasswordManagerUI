This project is a GUI-based password manager application that allows users to save and manage passwords for different websites.
This can all be done easily through a graphic interface. Users can add, edit, search, and delete stored entries, including website names, URLs, logins, and passwords.
The application also includes a simple built-in password generator that lets users create a unique password for each website.

To open and build the project, just clone all the files to any folder on your computer and run the PasswordManager.pro file. Qt Creator will automatically load every project file. All that's left is to build and run the application.

!Important notes! This project is created on C++ language, using Qt Creator with MSVC 2022 as the maintenance tool. You need them to build and run the project successfully
